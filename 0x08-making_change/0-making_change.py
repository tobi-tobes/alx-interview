Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of
coins needed to meet a given amount total.

  * Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)
  * Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
    * If total is 0 or less, return 0
    * If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
  * coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
  * The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
  * You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
  * Your solution's runtime will be evaluated in this task
